# Political-Elections
This analysis has been performed for pure curiosity after an interesting conversation with some friends, in which we were discussing the importance of abstensionism at the elections. In this context, the considered hypotesis is that an high level of abstensionism might be signficative in the emergence of new ideas and also new political parties, since non-voting is symptom of disagreement with the current status-quo. So I've tried to perform OLS and Panel Data Analysis to assess whether abstention from voting in Political Elections, in the main European Countries, could lead to the creation of new political parties. Also there is a specific regression just for Italy at the end, based on my interest.
